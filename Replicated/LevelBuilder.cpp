	Set what the current game world is (on server?)

	Create the functions to load the objects into that game world
	AddCubeToWorld
	AddSphereToWorld
	AddCapsuleToWorld

	Create a level reader object

	read in the current level from the JSON file
	using the ReadLevel() function on the level reader
	
	This will give a level reader object that has
	Vector3 of start pos
	Vector3 of end pos
	vector of groundcubeprimative objects
		each groundcubeprimvative has a pos and dim

	These will be used to create the cubes in the level
